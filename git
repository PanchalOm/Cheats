   git add -A
   git commit -m "description"
   git push -u origin master

# commit any files you've added with the git add command and also commits any files you've changed since then
  git commit -a

# Show file differences which are not yet staged
  git diff
  git diff --staged # show changes on staged files before being committed.

# Staged and Unstaged changes
staged - files have been marked for the next commit by using 'git add'
unstaged - files have not been marked for the next commit. In this case, you can discard the changes by running 'git restore'

# Git reset - unstages a file but preserves the file content
git reset <filename>
git reset commit  #undo all commits and preserves the changes locally
git reset --hard commit # discards all history and goes back to the specified commit

# git checkout - used to switch from one branch to another
git branch # displays the current branch
git checkout -b test # get out of the current branch, creates a new branch called test and switches to it.
git merge # matches the specified branch history to the current brach
