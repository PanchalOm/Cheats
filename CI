# CI and CD
CI - Contiuous integration - Allowing developers to seamlessly work on a product without getting on each other's toes and ensuring the codes are brought to a single point for testing 
CD - Continious Delivery- Releasing the versions of the ready product automatically
     Continuous Deployment - Continuously updating the released product which is now hosted by a cloud provider
Jenkins - Build management system, takes the code and builds it - is integrated with Docker
