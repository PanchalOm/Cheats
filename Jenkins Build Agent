Build agent: A separate server that receives instructions in the form of build job dispatches from the master.
You can have different build agents running different OSes depending on what you want to build.

Declaring an agent
agent any:
agent none
agent { label 'linux'}

Using a standalone build agent
Master connects to the build agent through ssh
Master initiates an ssh connection to the build agent using a pregenerated public and private key for authentication.
Master also transfers a jar file, remoting.jar, which contains a compacted version of jenkins containing just the required components to perform a distributed build.

Configuring ssh in the build agent:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install default-jre
# sudo apt install openssh-server
# sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
# sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
# cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
# sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jenkins agent key" -f "jenkinsagent_rsa"
# cat jenkinsagent_rsa.pub | sudo tee authorized keys
# sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins

Master Node
- Set credentials - ssh username with private key

Add build agent:
manage jenkins > manage nodes
