Master connects to the build agent through ssh
Master initiates an ssh connection to the build agent using a pregenerated public and private key for authentication.
Master also transfers a jar file, remoting.jar, which contains a compacted version of jenkins containing just the required components to perform a distributed build.

Configuring ssh in the build agent:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install default-jre
# sudo apt install openssh-server
# sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
# sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
# cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
# sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jenkins agent key" -f "jenkinsagent_rsa"
# cat jenkinsagent_rsa.pub | sudo tee authorized keys
# sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
