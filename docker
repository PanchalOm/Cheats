# Run nginx docker
sudo docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 nginx
# Adding custom HTML
# By default, Nginx looks in the /usr/share/nginx/html directory inside of the container for files to serve. We need to get our html files into this directory. A fairly simple way to do this is use a mounted volume. With mounted volumes, we are able to link a directory on our local machine and map that directory into our running container.
# Create a directory named site-content. In this directory add an index.html file and add content to it. Then start nginx as below:
sudo docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 -v ~/site-content:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
